# Cardiovascular Disease Classification

Below is the abstract portion of the research paper that goes along with this analysis. It tells you what my goal was and what was the outcome of my research. 

## Abstract 
There are many machine learning models that exist for classification purposes, but which one is the best one to use for your data. The dataset I had was a cardiovascular disease dataset and it contained certain features of individuals that had cardiovascular disease and those that did not. The features of these individuals that were recorded for this dataset were age, gender, height, weight, systolic blood pressure (ap_hi), diastolic blood pressure (ap_lo), cholesterol levels, glucose levels, did they smoke, did they drink, and did they do any physical activity. These are the features that I must use to classify if someone has cardiovascular disease or not, but as I stated there are so many machine learning techniques for classification which one do you pick. Well for my data I have determined that using a decision tree yields you the best results.  


## Installation 
1. You need to make sure you have python installed on your device 
    - Window: 
        - go to the link and download the latest python: python.org/downloads/
    - Mac
